Q: How does an I/O device get the attention of the CPU?

A: through interruptions. The CPU will write what it is doing onto memory, and then read the register of the I/O device and look up on its interruption table as to know what to do.


============

Q: Which special program is responsible for handling interrupts and exceptions?

A: interrupt handler and exception handler

============

Q: Why will code written for an x86 processor not run on an ARM processor?

A: no, they'll have different Instruction sets.

============

Q: Does address 0 always correspond to the first byte of RAM?

A: no, 

============

Q: When data is copied between RAM and CPU registers, it is usually copied through ___.

A: the CPU cache 

============


Q: When we copy 32-bit register A to address 500 of memory on a big-endian machine, the least-significant byte of register A is copied to address ___.


A: 531

============


Q: When we copy 32-bit register A to address 500 of memory on a little-endian machine, the least-significant byte of register A is copied to address ___.

A: 500

============

Q: When we say a machine is 32-bit or 64-bit, what are we usually talking about?

A: the bits that the processor have to store instruction set. It is also the memory address length that the processor can use to read/write data.
